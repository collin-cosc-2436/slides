---

## What is a Data Structure?

- A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data.
- Think of it as a system or method to keep track of information so that it's easy to find, update, or delete when
  needed.
- Think of it as a blueprint or a framework that allows data to be stored in a way that is both efficient and easy to
  work with.
- Common Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.

---

### Real-Life Example: The Bookshelf


Imagine you have a bookshelf full of books. The bookshelf itself is the data structure because it provides a framework to store your books (the data). Now, just like in programming, you can organize the books in different ways, and each way corresponds to a different type of data structure.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 2pt;">
      <ul style="font-size: 24pt;"> <li> Bookshelf: The structure that holds the books. In programming, this is like an array, a list, or another data structure that stores data. </li> <li> Books: The individual items being stored, representing the data. In programming, this could be numbers, words, or other pieces of information.</li> <li> Organization: The way you decide to arrange the books, such as putting all books of a certain genre together, is like different types of data structures (arrays, linked lists, etc.). Each type of organization provides unique advantages depending on how you want to store and retrieve your data. </li> 
    </ul>   
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 0 600px;">
        <img src="assets/bookshelf.png" alt="img">
    </div>
</div>

Each method of organizing the books provides a different way to efficiently store and retrieve the books (data). For example, a bookshelf organized by genre is like using a hashmap where books are categorized by their genre. The structure is the same (the bookshelf), but the way the data is organized changes based on how you intend to use it.

---

### Why is this Important?

Data structures are essential in computer science because they help in storing data in ways that make it easier to use.
For example:

- *Fast Searching*: If data are organized, you can find what you need quickly. Imagine trying to find a book on a
  shelf where all the books are randomly placed—that would take a lot of time!
- *Efficient Storage*: Some data structures help in storing data in a way that uses less memory, which is crucial when
  dealing with large amounts of data.
- *Easy Updates*: Just like how you can easily add or remove a book from a well-organized bookshelf, data structures
  help in efficiently adding, removing, or updating information.

## What is an Algorithm?

- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific problem or perform a task.
- Think of it as a recipe or a series of instructions that you follow to achieve a desired outcome.
- Algorithms are the backbone of computer programming; they tell the computer how to process data and make decisions.

---

### Real-Life Example:

Imagine you want to bake a cake. The recipe you follow is like an algorithm:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 2pt;">
      <ul style="font-size: 24pt;">
        <li> Gather Ingredients: You need flour, sugar, eggs, and other items before you can start. </li>
        <li> Follow Steps: The recipe gives you specific steps to combine the ingredients, bake the mixture, and eventually produce a cake. </li>
        <li> Desired Outcome: If you follow the recipe correctly, you end up with a delicious cake. </li>
      </ul>    
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 0 400px;">
        <img src="assets/bake.png" alt="img">
    </div>
</div>

Similarly, in programming, an algorithm is a set of instructions that guides the computer in solving a problem or performing a task. Each step in the algorithm brings you closer to the solution, just like each step in a recipe brings you closer to the finished dish.

---

### Why is this Important?

Algorithms are crucial in computer science because they form the logic behind how software and programs operate.
For example:

- *Efficiency*: The efficiency of an algorithm determines how quickly it can solve a problem or complete a task.
- *Problem-Solving*: Algorithms provide systematic ways to approach complex problems, breaking them down into manageable steps.
- *Automation*: By defining clear instructions through algorithms, we can automate tasks that would be tedious or impossible for humans to do manually.

## Understanding Arrays and ArrayList

---

### What is an Array?

- An array is a data structure that allows you to store fixed number of values of the same type in a single variable.
- Think of an array as a row of lockers in a school, where each locker can hold one item, and each locker is identified by its own unique number (index).

---

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

- To declare an array in Java:
  ```java
  int[] numbers;
  ```
- To initialize the array:
  ```java
  numbers = new int[5];  // Creates an array of 5 integers
  ```
- Arrays can also be initialized at the time of declaration:
  ```java
  int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  ```

---

### Memory and Arrays: How Arrays Relate to Memory
  - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that the elements of the array are placed next to each other in memory.
  - This allows for quick access to any element in the array by using its index.
  - However, this also means that arrays have a fixed size that must be defined when the array is created.
    ```java
      int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; 
    ``` 
    - `numbers[0]` might be at memory address `0x0010`.  
    - `numbers[1]` would then be at 0x0014 ==> `0x0010+(4*1)` if each int is 4 bytes long (which is typical for a 32-bit integer).  
    - This is why arrays index starts at 0, `0x0010+(4*2)` , `0x0010+(4*3)`, ...
    
---

### Single-Dimensional Arrays
  ```java
  int[] numbers = new int[5];  // Declaration and Initialization(heap memory allocation)
  numbers[0] = 10;  // Assigning values to array elements
  ```
  ```java
    int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Outputs: 30
  ```

---

### TWO And Multidimensional Arrays

- Arrays can have more than one dimension. The most common is a two-dimensional array (like a matrix): think of as grid or table with rows and columns.
  ```java
  int[][] array = new int[3][3]; // Creates a 3x3 array with all elements initialized to 0.
  ```
  ```java 
  //the array with predefined values:
  int[][] matrix = {
      {1, 2, 3},
      {4, 5, 6},
      {7, 8, 9}
  };
  System.out.println(matrix[1][2]);  // Outputs: 6
  ```
- Three-dimensional arrays are also possible:
    ```java
    int[][][] threeDArray = new int[3][3][3];
    ```
- Matrices are useful for mathematical computations, image processing, and more, like GPT can be thought of as utilizing arrays of arrays (matrices) to process large datasets efficiently.

---

### Array Operations

Accessing Array Elements
```java
//Use the index to access specific elements:
int firstNumber = numbers[0];  // Access the first element

//Iterating over an array:  
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

Searching for an element:

```java
  int searchValue = 30;
  boolean found = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] == searchValue) {
      found = true;
        break;
    }
  }
```  

Sorting an array:
```java
    Arrays.sort(numbers);
```

---

#### What is an ArrayList?
- An `ArrayList` is a resizable array, part of Java’s `java.util` package.
- Unlike standard arrays, ArrayLists are dynamic arrays that can resize themselves as needed. While arrays have a fixed size, ArrayLists can grow or shrink dynamically.
- `ArrayList` can only hold objects, meaning primitive types must be wrapped (e.g., `Integer` instead of `int`).  

  ```java
  ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
  names.add("Alice");
  names.add("Bob");
  
  ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
  list.add(10);
  list.add(20);
  System.out.println(list.get(1)); // Outputs: 20
  ```

---

### Common Operations with ArrayLists
Adding Elements
```java
  names.add("Charlie");
```
Accessing Elements
```java
  String name = names.get(0);  // Retrieves the first element
```
Removing Elements
```java
  names.remove("Alice");
```

---

### Array vs. ArrayList

| Feature | Array | ArrayList |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed size | Yes | No |
| Performance | Generally faster for basic operations | Slower for basic operations due to dynamic resizing |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | More flexible |
| Usage | When the size is known upfront | When the size is unknown or can vary |

    int minIndex = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {  
        minIndex = j;  
      }  
    }  
    int temp = arr[minIndex];
    arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
    arr[i] = temp;
  }
  ```

---

- <span class="fragment">Bubble Sort: Another simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</span> 
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        int temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

- <span class="fragment"> Binary Search: </span>
```java
  int operation(int[] arr, int key) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
      if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
      if (arr[mid] < key) left = mid + 1;
      else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1; // Key not found
  }
```
